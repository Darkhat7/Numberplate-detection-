🚀 Enhancing AI-Powered Vehicle Monitoring with YOLOv8! 🚗🔍

In my latest project, I worked on real-time number plate detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, but I wanted to take it a step further. Instead of just detecting number plates, I implemented a zoomed-in overlay above each detected plate for better visibility—making it easier to analyze details without losing context!

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Real-time number plate detection from video input
✅ AI-powered zoom-in overlay above each vehicle's plate
✅ Works efficiently for multiple vehicles in dynamic scenes
✅ Ensures optimal placement of the zoomed plate within the frame

🛠 Tech Stack:
🔹 YOLOv8 (for object detection)
🔹 OpenCV (for video processing)
🔹 PyTorch (for deep learning model inference)

This system can be a game-changer for smart surveillance, toll booths, parking management, and law enforcement applications! 🚓🏢

Would love to hear your thoughts! How else do you think this can be improved or applied in real-world scenarios? 💡👇
